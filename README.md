### Licensing Notice

"Light Services bot" is a bot originally made for Light Services.

Licensed use is allowed in TOS-obeying Discord servers.

Unlicensed use is forbidden.

### How to run?

To run the built version (if you don't have the full source code addon), run the index.js file using Node 20 or higher:

```shell
node index.js
```

If you have the full source code addon, you may run the bot using:

```shell
npm i -g ts-node
ts-node src/index.ts
```

Users with the full source code package purchased may still run the bot normally using the built version only.

The built version generally loads faster and is much easier to run, so if you don't intend on modifying the source code, use it.
