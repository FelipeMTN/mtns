### This is the language file.

### Use "\n" to create new lines or simply add an Enter symbol if the key uses multiline strings (must start with |).
### In most circumstances, using markdown formatting (like **bold**) is allowed but not guaranteed to work.

### Words in curly brackets: { } are placeholders for dynamic data, such as usernames, reasons etc.
### No matter the language this file is in, placeholders should be left in English, as they are replaced by the bot during runtime.
